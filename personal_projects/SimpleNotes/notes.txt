## SIMPLE NOTES ##
A simple notes app using tags
## Project Idea by Saahil Khemnani ##

- Basic notes app, either using vim or nano or emacs etc
- Use tags like -n to make a new file/note
                -a to add to a text file
- Files are saved in .txt, .rtf, or any other format
- Sync with Dropbox or any other cloud-based service
- add quick notes inline using "-i"
- support for \n, \t, etc (markdown?)

## Example Implementation ##

notes -n test.txt -i This is a test
notes -a test.txt -i \n This is another test

## NEW IMPLEMENTATION ##

Make it a series of aliases and functions (workflow) centered around cat

notes - pulls up the notes folder (Dropbox or local) and lses them
note - cat > note.txt to the notes folder
anote - cat note.txt && cat >> note.txt, appends to the note.txt
qnote - echo "$1" >> note.txt, adds note inline to the note.txt
rnote - cat /dev/null > note.txt, deletes all items in the note, resets is

## Things to figure out

* Deleting lines from a note
