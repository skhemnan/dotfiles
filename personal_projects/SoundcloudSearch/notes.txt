## Soundcloud Search/Indexer - possibly built in python
=====================================================
 - Using Soundcloud API, conduct a search, by building a search URL
 - Soundcloud API returns the json file, retrieve song name, artist, duration
 - print the results with index numbers before them
 - use index numbers similar to mpsyt and commands like download to hookup with 
   scdl (dependency) to download the song in the url

## Possible Inspiration to draw from
 * mpsyt
  - for indexing and printing json results (try looking at code, youtube json is 
    similar to python
 * ICS 32 API program
  - for how the functions are handled/setup, use similar functions for building
    search URL, retrieving and parseing the json (urllib.encoder)
